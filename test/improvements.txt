My integrity - I* wake up and take some important action every time the alarm goes off, without fail. -> Decide what the next action is for each improvement, then determine what the next action is that I*'ll do when the alarm goes off. 
My prioritizing - I* know the absolute, most important goals, beliefs, ID's, and actions to take at any moment, and they do not change. -> Define the most useful milestones for my self-utility goal, and work toward that. Also, keep going through my SI docs and bisection sort them.

My attitude toward time and self - I* hate wasting any time, and I* use every possible second toward the achievement of my goal - and define any undefined things... I* plan out every five minutes of my time. -> Have major items to get done each day. 
My focus on my understanding goal 100% of the time until it's achieved -> (Quit my job) Create and write out 10 details for when it's done, then bisection search it and focus on those. 
My scheduling
My understanding of Physics and the machines I* use
