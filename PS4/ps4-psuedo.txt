Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:

Best function:
	Shift the text
	Recognize words function:
		Select text until a space - if it matches a word, go to spot after the space, and select it until just before the next space. If it matches a word, repeat this.
		If it returns 3 matching words, return True
		Else return False
	If Recognize words function, return current text
	Else return Best function with current text
Go back to step #2



Take a sample of the first 20 letters
Apply a de-shifter of 1
If any of the letter combos match a real word (not 'a'), then use it
Else increase the de-shift by 1
Repeat steps #3-4 until a real word is found

Write out your algorithm for Problem 4 here:

Shift the whole text until a real word pops up
Mark the starting location of the real word and the current shift into a tuple, into a list
Shift the remaining text until another real word pops up
Mark the starting location of the real word and the current shift into a tuple, into a list
Repeat # 3-4 until all 27 shifts are done
