# Problem 1
# Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the
# minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.
# Use raw_input() to ask for the following three floating point numbers:
# 1. the outstanding balance on the credit card
# 2. annual interest rate
# 3. minimum monthly payment rate
# For each month, print:
#	- the minimum monthly payment, 
#	- remaining balance, 
#	- principle paid in the
# format shown in the test cases below. All numbers should be rounded to the nearest penny.
# Finally, print the result, which should include the total amount paid that year and the remaining
# balance

# remaining_balance = float(input('What*s the current balance on the credit card: '))
# annual_interest_rate = float(input('What*s the APY of the card: '))
# minimum_monthly_payment_rate = float(input("What*s the minimum monthly payment rate: "))

# Paying Debt Off In a Year
# Problem 2 
	
# Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay
# off a credit card balance within 12 months. We will not be dealing with a minimum monthly
# payment rate.
# Take as raw_input() the following floating point numbers:
# 	1. the outstanding balance on the credit card
# 	2. annual interest rate as a decimal 
# Print out:
#	the fixed minimum monthly payment, 
#	number of months (at most 12 and possibly less than 12) it takes to pay off the debt, and 
#	the balance (likely to be a negative number).
# Assume that the interest is compounded monthly according to the balance at the start of the
# month (before the payment for that month is made). The monthly payment must be a multiple of
# $10 and is the same for all months. Notice that it is possible for the balance to become negative
# using this payment scheme. In short:
# Monthly interest rate = Annual interest rate / 12.0
# Updated balance each month = Previous balance * (1 + Monthly interest rate) â€“ Minimum
# monthly payment
